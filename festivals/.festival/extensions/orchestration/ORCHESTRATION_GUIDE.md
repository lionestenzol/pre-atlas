## Planning Phase

### Step 1: Festival Complexity Analysis

Before deciding on orchestration, evaluate:

```
Complexity Factors:
□ Multiple technical domains (frontend, backend, database, blockchain, etc.)
□ 5+ major components or services
□ Cross-cutting concerns (security, performance, monitoring)
□ Integration requirements between systems
□ Parallel development opportunities
□ High quality requirements needing specialized validation
```

**Decision Matrix:**

- High complexity + parallel opportunities = **Use Orchestration**
- Medium complexity + sequential work = **Consider Single Agent**
- Low complexity = **Use Single Agent**

### Step 2: Domain Decomposition

Break down the festival into logical technical domains:

1. **Identify Core Domains**

   - List all technical areas the festival touches
   - Group related functionality together
   - Identify natural boundaries and interfaces

2. **Map Domain Dependencies**

   - Which domains can work in parallel?
   - Which have sequential dependencies?
   - What are the integration points?

3. **Estimate Domain Complexity**
   - Simple domains (1-2 files, straightforward logic)
   - Medium domains (3-10 files, moderate complexity)
   - Complex domains (10+ files, intricate business logic)

### Step 3: Parallel vs Sequential Analysis

**Parallel Opportunities:**

- Independent components that don't share interfaces
- Different layers of the architecture (API, core, infrastructure)
- Separate services or modules
- Documentation and testing (when interfaces are defined)

**Sequential Dependencies:**

- Interface definitions must precede implementations
- Core business logic before API endpoints
- Database schemas before data access layers
- Infrastructure before service deployment

## Agent Design

### Step 1: Agent Role Definition

For each domain identified, create an agent with:

```markdown
## Agent Name: [Domain] Specialist

### Expertise Areas:

- Primary technology stack
- Specific domain knowledge
- Architecture patterns used

### Responsibilities:

- Specific files/directories owned
- Functions and components managed
- Integration points maintained

### Dependencies:

- What this agent needs from other agents
- What this agent provides to other agents
- Timing requirements for handoffs
```

### Step 2: Agent Specialization Levels

**Lead Architect Agent:**

- Maintains overall vision and architecture
- Coordinates between specialists
- Makes architectural decisions
- Handles integration concerns

**Domain Specialist Agents:**

- Deep expertise in specific technical areas
- Owns specific components or services
- Implements domain-specific business logic
- Provides domain expertise to other agents

**Infrastructure/Support Agents:**

- Configuration and deployment
- Testing and quality assurance
- Documentation and user guides
- Performance and monitoring

### Step 3: Communication Protocols

Define how agents communicate:

**Interface Contracts:**

- Clear input/output specifications
- Error handling requirements
- Performance expectations
- Documentation standards

**Handoff Procedures:**

- Quality gate criteria
- Validation requirements
- Knowledge transfer formats
- Next agent notification process

## Dependency Mapping

### Step 1: Create Dependency Graph

```
Phase 001: Foundation
├── Architect defines interfaces and contracts
├── Infrastructure sets up basic project structure
└── Quality gates: Interfaces documented and validated

Phase 002: Parallel Implementation
├── Domain A Specialist (depends on interfaces from Phase 001)
├── Domain B Specialist (depends on interfaces from Phase 001)
├── Domain C Specialist (depends on interfaces from Phase 001)
└── Documentation Agent (depends on interfaces from Phase 001)

Phase 003: Integration
├── Integration Specialist (depends on all Phase 002 outputs)
├── Testing Agent (validates integration)
└── Quality gates: End-to-end testing passes
```

### Step 2: Critical Path Analysis

Identify the longest chain of dependent tasks:

- These tasks determine minimum festival duration
- Focus orchestration on parallelizing off critical path
- Monitor critical path tasks closely

### Step 3: Parallel Track Identification

Find tasks that can run simultaneously:

- Different architectural layers
- Independent business domains
- Documentation and implementation (when interfaces are stable)
- Testing preparation and development

## Interface-First Principles

### Step 1: Define Clear Contracts

Before any implementation begins:

```typescript
// Example: API Contract Definition
interface UserService {
  createUser(userData: UserCreateRequest): Promise<UserResponse>;
  getUserById(id: string): Promise<UserResponse>;
  updateUser(id: string, updates: UserUpdateRequest): Promise<UserResponse>;
}

interface UserCreateRequest {
  email: string;
  username: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Step 2: Establish Error Handling Standards

```typescript
// Example: Error Contract
interface ServiceError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

// Example: Response Contract
interface ServiceResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: ServiceError;
}
```

### Step 3: Documentation Requirements

Each interface must include:

- Purpose and business context
- Input/output specifications
- Error scenarios and handling
- Performance expectations
- Usage examples

## Quality Gates and Handoffs

### Step 1: Define Quality Gates

**Phase Completion Criteria:**

```
Foundation Phase Complete When:
□ All interfaces are documented
□ Error handling patterns defined
□ Database schema designed
□ API contracts specified
□ Architecture decisions documented

Implementation Phase Complete When:
□ All domain logic implemented
□ Unit tests passing
□ Integration points functional
□ Error handling implemented
□ Code review completed

Integration Phase Complete When:
□ End-to-end tests passing
□ Performance requirements met
□ Security validation complete
□ Documentation updated
□ Deployment successful
```

### Step 2: Handoff Procedures

**Agent-to-Agent Handoff:**

1. Completing agent creates handoff document
2. Receiving agent validates prerequisites
3. Knowledge transfer session (if needed)
4. Receiving agent confirms readiness
5. Work transitions to next phase

**Handoff Document Template:**

```markdown
## Handoff: [From Agent] to [To Agent]

### Work Completed:

- List of files created/modified
- Features implemented
- Tests written
- Documentation updated

### Outstanding Issues:

- Known limitations
- TODO items for next agent
- Technical debt notes

### Integration Points:

- How this work connects to other components
- Dependencies satisfied
- Dependencies created for others

### Validation:

- Tests run and results
- Manual testing performed
- Code review status
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Festival Initialization

1. **Create Orchestration Plan**

   - Use `templates/ORCHESTRATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Define all phases and agents
   - Map dependencies and parallel tracks

2. **Set Up Quality Gates**

   - Define completion criteria for each phase
   - Establish validation procedures
   - Create handoff document templates

3. **Initialize Agent Templates**
   - Create agent specifications using `templates/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Define responsibilities and interfaces
   - Plan communication protocols

### Step 2: Phase 001 - Foundation

- Standards defined and communicated

### Step 3: Phase 002 - Parallel Implementation

**Launch Specialist Agents:**

- Each agent works on their domain
- Follow interface contracts from Phase 001
- Implement domain-specific logic
- Create comprehensive tests
- Document implementation decisions

**Coordination:**

- Regular check-ins with Lead Architect
- Interface clarifications as needed
- Dependency resolution
- Quality assurance validation

### Step 4: Phase 003 - Integration

**Integration Specialist Tasks:**

- Combine all domain implementations
- Resolve integration issues
- Validate end-to-end functionality
- Performance testing and optimization
- Final quality assurance

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Premature Parallelization

**Problem:** Starting parallel work before interfaces are well-defined
**Solution:** Always complete interface design before parallel implementation

### 2. Poor Coordination

**Problem:** Agents working in isolation without proper communication
**Solution:** Regular check-ins and clear handoff procedures

### 3. Quality Gate Skipping

**Problem:** Moving to next phase without proper validation
**Solution:** Strict adherence to quality gate criteria

### 4. Over-Orchestration

**Problem:** Using orchestration for simple festivals
**Solution:** Apply complexity analysis to determine if orchestration is beneficial

### 5. Insufficient Interface Design

**Problem:** Vague or incomplete interface definitions
**Solution:** Comprehensive interface documentation with examples

### 6. Architectural Drift

**Problem:** Different agents making conflicting architectural decisions
**Solution:** Strong Lead Architect oversight and clear architectural standards
