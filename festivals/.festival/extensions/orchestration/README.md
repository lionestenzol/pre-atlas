# Agent Orchestration Technique Templates

## Overview

Agent orchestration is an advanced festival technique that enables complex, multi-faceted development tasks to be executed through specialized agent teams working in parallel. This approach dramatically accelerates development cycles by leveraging the unique strengths of different agent specializations while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity.

## What is Agent Orchestration?

Agent orchestration involves:

1. **Breaking down complex festivals into specialized domains**
2. **Creating specialized agents with focused expertise**
3. **Enabling parallel execution through interface-first design**
4. **Coordinating handoffs between agents at quality gates**
5. **Maintaining architectural coherence through a lead architect agent**

## Core Concept: Specialized Agent Teams

Instead of a single agent handling all aspects of a complex festival, orchestration creates a team of specialists:

- **Architect Agent**: Maintains overall vision and coordinates between specialists
- **Domain Specialists**: Focus on specific technical areas (blockchain, database, API, etc.)
- **Infrastructure Engineers**: Handle deployment, configuration, and operational concerns
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure testing, validation, and integration standards
- **Documentation Experts**: Maintain technical documentation and user guides

## Benefits of Orchestration

### Parallel Development

- Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different components
- Reduces overall festival completion time from sequential to parallel execution
- Enables complex festivals that would be too large for a single agent

### Specialized Expertise

- Each agent can focus on their area of expertise
- Higher quality outcomes through deep specialization
- Better handling of complex technical domains

### Scalability

- Large festivals can be decomposed into manageable chunks
- Work can be distributed across multiple agent sessions
- Maintains architectural integrity across large codebases

### Quality Assurance

- Built-in quality gates at agent handoff points
- Specialized testing and validation at each layer
- Comprehensive documentation through dedicated documentation agents

## When to Use Orchestration vs Single Agent

### Use Orchestration When

- Festival involves 5+ major components or services
- Multiple technical domains are involved (frontend, backend, database, blockchain, etc.)
- Parallel development can significantly reduce completion time
- Quality requirements are high and need specialized validation
- The festival will benefit from interface-first design principles

### Use Single Agent When

- Festival is focused on a single domain or component
- Sequential execution is more appropriate
- The scope is manageable for a single specialized agent
- Coordination overhead would exceed the parallel development benefits

## Template Structure

This directory contains the following orchestration resources:

### Core Templates

- `templates/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` - Standard template for creating specialized agents
- `templates/ORCHESTRATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` - Template for planning orchestrated festivals

### Implementation Guides

- `ORCHESTRATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide for implementing orchestration
- `patterns/COMMON_PATTERNS.md` - Proven orchestration patterns
- `patterns/AGENT_ARCHETYPES.md` - Reusable agent role definitions

### Case Studies

- `examples/blockchain-verification-example.md` - Real-world orchestration example

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For New Festivals

1. **Analyze Complexity**: Determine if orchestration benefits outweigh coordination costs
2. **Identify Domains**: Break the festival into logical technical domains
3. **Plan Dependencies**: Map sequential vs parallel work opportunities
4. **Design Interfaces**: Create clear contracts between agent responsibilities
5. **Select Patterns**: Choose appropriate orchestration patterns from the library
6. **Customize Agents**: Adapt agent templates to your specific technical domains

### Key Principles

- **Interface-First Design**: Enable parallel development through well-defined contracts
- **Quality Gates**: Establish clear handoff criteria between agents
- **Architectural Coherence**: Maintain system integrity through architect coordination
- **Incremental Integration**: Build and test components incrementally
- **Documentation-Driven**: Ensure all agents maintain comprehensive documentation

## Success Metrics

A successful orchestration should demonstrate:

- **Time Efficiency**: Parallel execution reduces overall festival time
- **Quality Maintenance**: Code quality standards are maintained across all agents
- **Architectural Integrity**: The final system has coherent design principles
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of the festival are thoroughly addressed
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Clear documentation enables future maintenance

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Over-orchestration**: Using orchestration for simple festivals that don't benefit from parallelism
- **Poor Interface Design**: Unclear contracts between agents leading to integration issues
- **Insufficient Coordination**: Lack of architect oversight leading to architectural drift
- **Premature Parallelization**: Starting parallel work before interfaces are well-defined
- **Quality Gate Skipping**: Moving to next phase without proper validation

## Getting Started

1. Read through `ORCHESTRATION_GUIDE.md` for implementation steps
2. Review the blockchain verification example for real-world patterns
3. Select appropriate templates and patterns for your festival
4. Adapt the templates to your specific technical domains
5. Plan your orchestration phases and quality gates

Remember: Orchestration is a powerful technique, but it requires careful planning and coordination. Start with the guides and examples to understand the principles before adapting to your specific needs.
