# Common Orchestration Patterns

## Overview

This document outlines proven orchestration patterns that can be applied to different types of festivals. Each pattern represents a different approach to organizing and coordinating agent teams, with specific strengths and ideal use cases.

## Pattern Classification

### By Coordination Style

- **Hub-and-Spoke**: Central coordinator with specialized agents
- **Pipeline**: Sequential handoffs between specialists
- **Matrix**: Cross-functional collaboration
- **Swarm**: Autonomous parallel execution

### By Complexity Level

- **Simple**: 3-5 agents, single domain
- **Moderate**: 5-7 agents, 2-3 domains
- **Complex**: 7+ agents, multiple domains with dependencies

## Hub-and-Spoke Pattern

### Structure

```
           Lead Architect Agent
                    |
        +-----------+-----------+
        |           |           |
   Specialist A  Specialist B  Specialist C
        |           |           |
   Domain A      Domain B     Domain C
```

### Characteristics

- **Central Coordinator**: One lead agent manages all coordination
- **Specialized Spokes**: Each agent focuses on a specific domain
- **Interface-Driven**: Central coordination through well-defined interfaces
- **Quality Control**: Central agent ensures consistency and quality

### When to Use

- **Multiple Independent Domains**: When domains have minimal interdependencies
- **Clear Specialization**: When expertise requirements are distinct
- **Quality Critical**: When architectural consistency is paramount
- **Time Sensitive**: When parallel development offers significant time savings

### Example: Blockchain Verification Festival

```
blockchain-verification-architect (Hub)
├── galachain-query-specialist (Blockchain operations)
├── test-infrastructure-engineer (Test framework)
├── verification-contract-implementer (Contract verification)
├── e2e-scenario-builder (End-to-end testing)
├── test-enhancement-specialist (Existing test upgrades)
└── documentation-qa-specialist (Documentation & QA)
```

### Phases

1. **Planning Phase**: Hub agent defines overall architecture
2. **Interface Phase**: Hub coordinates interface definition with all spokes
3. **Implementation Phase**: Spokes work in parallel on their domains
4. **Integration Phase**: Hub coordinates integration and quality assurance

### Advantages

- Clear coordination and responsibility
- Parallel development across domains
- Consistent architectural vision
- Quality control through central oversight

### Disadvantages

- Central bottleneck if hub agent becomes overloaded
- Potential for reduced innovation in individual domains
- Coordination overhead for complex dependencies

### Best Practices

- Hub agent must be experienced in all domains

- Well-defined interface contracts before parallel work begins

## Pipeline Pattern

### Structure

```
Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Agent D
(Step 1)  (Step 2)  (Step 3)  (Step 4)
```

### Characteristics

- **Sequential Execution**: Each agent completes work before handing off
- **Specialized Processing**: Each agent adds specific value
- **Clear Handoffs**: Well-defined transition points

- **Quality Critical**: When each step must be validated before proceeding
- **Learning Contexts**: When later agents need learnings from earlier agents

### Example: API Design Pipeline

```
requirements-analyst → api-designer → implementer → tester → documenter
```

### Phases

1. **Requirements Agent**: Analyzes needs and defines specifications
2. **Design Agent**: Creates detailed API design and contracts
3. **Implementation Agent**: Builds the API according to design
4. **Testing Agent**: Validates implementation against requirements
5. **Documentation Agent**: Creates comprehensive documentation

### Advantages

- Feedback loops for issues requiring rework
- Buffer time for unexpected issues

## Matrix Pattern

### Structure

```
        Frontend    Backend    Database
        Agent       Agent      Agent
          |           |          |
API   ----+-------- --+----------+----
Layer     |           |          |
          |           |          |
Core  ----+-------- --+----------+----
Logic     |           |          |
          |           |          |
Data  ----+-------- --+----------+----
Layer     |           |          |
```

### Characteristics

- **Cross-Functional Teams**: Agents collaborate across domains and layers
- **Shared Responsibility**: Multiple agents may work on same components
- **Rich Communication**: Frequent coordination between agents
- **Flexible Assignment**: Work can be reassigned based on capacity and expertise

### When to Use

- **Cross-Cutting Features**: When features span multiple domains

## Swarm Pattern

### Structure

```
   Agent A    Agent B    Agent C    Agent D
      |          |          |          |
   Task 1 ←→  Task 2 ←→  Task 3 ←→  Task 4
      ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
   Complete   Complete   Complete   Complete
```

### Characteristics

- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents work independently on tasks
- **Emergent Coordination**: Coordination emerges from agent interactions
- **Flexible Task Assignment**: Tasks can be reassigned dynamically

### When to Use

- **Independent Tasks**: When tasks have minimal dependencies
- **Uncertain Requirements**: When requirements may change during execution
- **Exploration Projects**: When the solution approach is not predetermined
- **High Autonomy**: When agents have strong independent capabilities

### Example: Bug Fix Festival

```
Each agent takes bugs from a shared queue:
- Agent A: Frontend bugs
- Agent B: Backend bugs  
- Agent C: Database bugs
- Agent D: Integration bugs
(Agents can switch types based on queue priorities)
```

### Phases

1. **Task Pool Creation**: Create a shared pool of well-defined tasks
2. **Agent Deployment**: Deploy agents to work autonomously
