## Customization Notes

### Adapting This Template

When customizing this template:

1. **Replace all placeholders** with specific values for your festival
2. **Adjust agent composition** based on your technical domains
3. **Customize quality gates** to match your requirements
4. **Define specific deliverables** for each phase and agent
5. **Set realistic timelines** based on complexity assessment

### Template Variations

**For Large Festivals (10+ agents):**

- Add sub-teams and coordination layers
- Include additional quality gates
- Define more detailed communication protocols

**For Small Festivals (3-5 agents):**

- Simplify communication protocols
- Combine some agent roles
- Streamline quality gates

**For Research-Heavy Festivals:**

- Add research and discovery phases
- Include prototype and validation cycles
- Plan for multiple iteration cycles

Remember: This plan should be a living document that evolves as the festival progresses and new information becomes available.
