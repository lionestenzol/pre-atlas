# AI-Powered Python CLI Assistant - README

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Python coding assistant** that runs in the command line. Instead of just searching for answers, this assistant **recognizes patterns, suggests completions, and autocompletes Python functions** based on how developers think.

It is built using:
- **A knowledge graph** that maps Python functions to their most commonly associated patterns.
- **AI-powered predictions** that suggest the next best function or concept.
- **A CLI interface** with real-time input handling and autocompletion.

## Features
✅ **Pattern Recognition** - AI understands Python function relationships.  
✅ **Intelligent Code Suggestions** - Get real-time function recommendations.  
✅ **Auto-Completion** - Press `TAB` to complete functions as you type.  
✅ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** - No GUI needed; works in the terminal.  
✅ **Expandable Knowledge Graph** - Easily add more Python functions and patterns.  

## How It Works
### 1️⃣ Knowledge Graph - Mapping Function Relationships
The **knowledge graph** stores associations between Python functions, similar to how a developer would naturally recall related commands.

Example:
```python
knowledge_graph = {
    "open": ["os.path.exists", "with open()", "read", "write"],
    "list": ["append", "sort", "reverse", "extend"],
    "dict": ["keys()", "values()", "items()", "update()"],
    "import os": ["os.path.join", "os.remove", "os.getcwd"],
    "requests.get": ["json.loads", "requests.post", "try/except"]
}
```
🔹 **If a user types `open()`, AI suggests `os.path.exists()` before opening a file.**  
🔹 **If a user types `import os`, AI suggests `os.path.join()` for working with paths.**

### 2️⃣ Command-Line Interface (CLI) - Real-Time User Interaction
Users can type Python functions or concepts, and the AI will instantly return suggestions based on the knowledge graph.

Example CLI behavior:
```
>> open file
🔮 AI Suggestions: os.path.exists, with open(), read, write
```

### 3️⃣ Intelligent Autocomplete
The assistant uses **real-time autocompletion** with Python’s `readline` module. When a user types part of a function name and presses `TAB`, the AI completes it automatically.

```python
import readline

def completer(text, state):
    """Auto-complete function for user input."""
    options = [cmd for cmd in knowledge_graph.keys() if cmd.startswith(text)]
    return options[state] if state < len(options) else None

readline.set_completer(completer)
readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
```
🔹 **User types:** `impor` + `[TAB]` → `import os`  
🔹 **User types:** `lis` + `[TAB]` → `list.append()`

## Installation & Running
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed (3.6+ recommended). Install `readline` if necessary (on Windows, `pyreadline3`).
```bash
pip install pyreadline3  # Windows only
```

### **2️⃣ Run the AI Assistant**
```bash
python ai_assistant.py
```
This will launch the command-line AI assistant.

## Expanding the Knowledge Graph
The AI assistant can learn more patterns by expanding the knowledge graph.

**Adding More Functions:**
```python
knowledge_graph["numpy array"] = ["np.array", "np.zeros", "np.ones"]
```
Now if a user types `numpy array`, AI will suggest `np.array`, `np.zeros`, and `np.ones`.

## Future Enhancements
🚀 **AI-Powered Explanations** - AI will explain functions in natural language.
🚀 **Context Awareness** - AI will analyze full Python scripts and suggest improvements.
🚀 **Web-Based Version** - Convert this into an interactive AI coding tool.

## Conclusion
This AI-powered Python CLI assistant **goes beyond search** by **understanding Python relationships** and **predicting what you need next**. It brings a **human-like intelligence** to the coding experience by thinking the way developers do.

💡 **Next Step:** Deploy this CLI tool and expand it with AI-powered explanations! 🚀
