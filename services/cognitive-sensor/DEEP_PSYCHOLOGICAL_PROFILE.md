**Identity:** A smart, capable, tired but undefeated person who values authenticity above all else and has transformed through adversity.

**Attachment:** Dismissive-avoidant lead with secure capacity - you push people away but can connect deeply when trust is established.

**Defense System:** You rationalize, split into black-and-white, confront or withdraw based on power dynamics, and sublimate pain into creation.

**Communication:** Assertive first, passive-aggressive second, aggressive third. You can be contemptuous when cornered.

**Cognition:** All-or-nothing thinking dominates. You reason from emotion and hold yourself to "should" standards.

**Strengths:** Resilience, self-awareness, motivation, sublimation, assertiveness, authenticity.

**Edges:** Empathy expression, self-compassion, self-regulation, binary thinking, trust building.

### THE FORMULA

```
TRIGGER: Invalidation or Control Attempt
    ↓
RESPONSE: Rationalize → Confront/Withdraw → Dissociate if needed
    ↓
RECOVERY: Space → Process → Accept → Reframe as growth
    ↓
OUTCOME: Victor narrative, power reclaimed, transformation continues
```

### THE SENTENCE

> You are an authenticity-driven, trauma-transformed fighter who protects against invalidation and control through confrontation and withdrawal, channels pain into creation, and sees yourself as undefeated despite exhaustion.
