## The 4 Derailment Chains

### CHAIN 1: THE PHONE TRAP (1,217 mentions)

```
Pick up phone --> Get distracted --> Lose time -->
Feel guilty --> "Whatever" --> Start over tomorrow
```

Your #1 distraction. Hours disappear here.

### CHAIN 2: THE EXHAUSTION TRAP (502 mentions)

```
Push too hard --> Get exhausted --> "Can't" -->
Stop --> Feel bad --> Promise to start fresh
```

You run until empty, then crash.

### CHAIN 3: THE PEOPLE TRAP (1,081 mentions)

```
Someone disrespects --> Get pissed --> Focus on them -->
Lose focus on goal --> Hours/days pass --> Reset
```

When someone disrespects you, everything stops. Trust broken = focus broken.

### CHAIN 4: THE MONEY TRAP (386 mentions)

```
See opportunity --> Realize cost --> "Can't afford" -->
Feel stuck --> Don't try --> Wait for "someday"
```

Financial pressure freezes action.

## The Core Insight

**#1 derailment: PHONE** (1,509 mentions)
**#2 derailment: PEOPLE** (disrespect + betrayal = 1,011 combined)

These two things steal more of your focus than everything else combined.

### The Pattern

1. You have a goal
2. Phone steals your time, OR someone pisses you off
3. You lose hours/days processing
4. You get tired from the distraction
5. You say "whatever" or "tomorrow"
6. Repeat

## The Two Interventions That Would Change Everything

### 1. PHONE: Create friction between you and the device

- Put it in a different room
- Use app blockers
- Schedule specific times for phone use
- Turn off notifications
- Grayscale mode

### 2. PEOPLE: Set a time limit on processing disrespect

- "I give this 10 minutes, then I'm back to work."
- Write it down, get it out, then move on
- Don't let someone else's behavior control your day
- Their disrespect is not worth your goals

---

## The Question to Ask

When you notice yourself getting derailed, ask:

**"Is this phone/person worth losing another day?"**

The phone will still be there later.
The person isn't going to change because you spent 3 hours upset.
Your goal is waiting.
